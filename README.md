# Simple-Math-Games
Originally built for a Software Development class in one semester, but still polished and functional and I've been adding extra functionality. A program to help 1st and 2nd grade students improve their addition and subtraction skills while having fun. Features 3 different games, as well as high scores and stats. There are several options allowing teachers and students to better fit the learning experience to each individual. For example, a teacher can add custom problem sets for the students in their class. There are also many different administration tools available, such as adding users individually or via csv file.
